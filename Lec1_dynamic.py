'''
    Python Programming Language is dyanamically typed
    and an interpretted language.

    i.e
    variables do not have a static type and it is executed
    line by line 

'''

name = 'Aaqid'
print(type(name))
# output <class 'str'>

name = 5
print(type(name))
# output <class 'int'>

'''
    we see in the above example that the variable 
    name does not have a static data type and is able
    to change during the execution of the program.
'''


'''

    Below is an example to illustrate the python code is not
    pre complied and is executed line by line

'''

print("Salman")
print("Basit")
print("Aaqid")
print(asfsdafd) # here the program will crash
print("Basit")
print("Aaqid")


'''
    in the above example everything about the crash is
    run easily and python only throws an error when it 
    reaches the line that throws an exception and only then
    the execution of the program is stopped.
