# tuples are just like lists but they are immutable
# TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE

# you can put data in a tuple that you do not want to change in your program
# origin_coordinates = (-15,30,100)


# origin_coordinates[-1] = 100

# not recommended way because it can cause confusion among programer

# if tuple contains 1 item

# numbers = (75, 'Hello', (1,2,[]), 92, 94, 94, ['Hello', 'World'], 92, 75, 80)

# numbers[2][2].append('Hello')


# print(numbers)
# print(len(numbers))
# print(type(numbers[2]))

# numbers[6].append(5)
# print(type(numbers[6]))
# print(numbers)

# multiple datatypes can exist

# print(numbers.index(94))
# print(numbers.count(94))


# print(numbers[2]) # what is at index 2
# print(numbers.index('Basit')) # what is the index of 'Basit'


# x = (1,2,3)
# x = 1,2,3

# print(x[0])
# print(x[1])
# print(x[2])
