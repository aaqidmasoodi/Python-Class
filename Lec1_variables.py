'''
    Making variables in python is pretty simple.
    we simply pick a name and assign it some value.
'''

# Example
name = 'Aaqid'


'''
    name is now a variable containing a string object
'''

# similarly we can make more examples

age = 22
marks = 9.2


'''
    variables can also be printed
'''


# example

print(name)
print(age)
print(marks)
